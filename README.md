# Dawn-main

## Description 
**Dawn-main** is a clone version of Shopify Dawn Theme. I cloned it for the purpose of adding a section into the theme under the following guidelines:
- Clone the Dawn theme using Shopify CLI
- Develop a new customizable section within the theme that allows the merchant to choose a product, specify up to 5 feature bullet points, and set the CTA button text and link.
- Implement the section using Liquid for dynamic content rendering.
- Style the section with plain CSS, ensuring it is responsive and cohesive with other sections in the theme.
- (Bonus) Create a web component that automatically cycles through the bullet points, adding an engaging element to the section
